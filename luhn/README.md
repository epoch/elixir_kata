# Luhn Algorithm

It's an algorithm of check-digits for credit card numbers. It's by no
means perfect, but catches a number of typical typographic errors.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) has a good
writeup.

It came up on the Elixir Slack channel and I decided to give it a try
just for fun.
